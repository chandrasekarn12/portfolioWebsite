                                no knowledge of what it's capable of and not know how fast objects in front it are moving, but it will be able to grab those objects.
                                We'll be doing this by developing an AI using PyToch and using Mujoco to simulate the scenario.

                                I analyzed incoming payment information from the US and Canada and manipulated it accordingly.
                                I then took this data and created a UI with PowerBI to present it. The UI is live and responsive, and updates daily
                                with the payments of that day. The data is given to UPS in the form of csv files. I used Java to 
                                load the information into an SQL server I helped design, and the UI pulls data from the server.
                                This UI will be used by senior management to help guide future business decision.

                                I also worked on migrating batch procesing jobs from Spring Batch to Spring Cloud Data flows. I utilized GKE and Kubernetes
                                to implement these batch jobs.
