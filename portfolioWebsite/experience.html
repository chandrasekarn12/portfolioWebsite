                                I analyzed incoming payment information from the US and Canada and manipulated it accordingly.
                                I then took this data and created a UI with PowerBI to present it. The UI is live and responsive, and updates daily
                                with the payments of that day. The data is given to UPS in the form of csv files. I used Java to 
                                load the information into an SQL server I helped design, and the UI pulls data from the server.
                                This UI will be used by senior management to help guide future business decision.

                                I worked with a team of people from various parts of the world to remake the Eureka Academy website.
                                Throughout my time there, I optimized the page design, optimized its code, and helped improve
                                search engine optimization.
