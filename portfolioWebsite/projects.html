                                I built a portfolio website to serve as a digital form of my resume.
                                It includes some basic information about me, my resume, my projects, my skills,
                                and information about my club.
                            </p>
                            <br>
                            <p>
                                I built this website using HTML, CSS, and a bit of JavaScript. This is a static website,
                                so I hosted it on Amazon S3. The URL generated by S3 is long and hard to type in, so I used
                                AWS's DNS service, Route 53, to alias the URL to "nikhilchandrasekar.click" for viewer convenience.
