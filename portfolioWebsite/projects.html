                                I designed a portal for clients and UPS to keep track of project status with my Hackathon team. This is a full stack application
                                that would take inputs about project informaiton and display it. We won 3rd place in the Microsoft category out of 52 teams of UPS 
                                employees, co-ops, and interns. I can't show the project due to UPS policy.

                                We connected the front and back ends of the applicatio with Microsoft Dataverse to receive and display project status updates.
                                These were displayed with PowerApps and PowerBI. All of this was done in a 24 hour window.

                                I built a portfolio website to serve as a digital form of my resume.
                                It includes some basic information about me, my resume, my projects, my skills,
                                and information about my club.

                                I built this website using HTML, CSS, and a bit of JavaScript. This is a static website,
                                so I hosted it on Amazon S3. The URL generated by S3 is long and hard to type in, so I used
                                AWS's DNS service, Route 53, to alias the URL to "nikhilchandrasekar.click" for viewer convenience.
