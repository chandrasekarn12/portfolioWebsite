                                My hackathon team and I designed a portal of UPS employees and clients to keep track of the status of healthcare projects. 
                                This is a full-stack application, and we placed 3rd out of 52 teams of full-time UPS employees, co-ops, and interns. I can't show
                                the project due to UPS policy.

                                We connected the front and back ends of the applicatio with Microsoft Dataverse to receive and display project status updates.
                                These were displayed with PowerApps and PowerBI. All of this was done in a 24 hour window.

                                I designed an improved version of the UPS payment widget with my Hackathon team. We revamped the online experience to prioritize
                                ACH transactions, which save UPS time and money over the traditional checks and credit card payment options. I can't show
                                the project due to UPS policy.
