                                My latest interest has been Cloud Computing. I've been able to nurture this interest
                                by learning more about Cloud Computing by studying AWS and Microsoft Azure as well as making
                                Cloud Computing projects like this one. I'm also able to share this interest with others as 
                                an AWS-appointed Cloud Club Captain at the University of Maryland.

                                I've been interested in Big Data and Machine Learning since high school. I've really expanded
                                my skills in this field during my time at UPS, which I analyzed payment information and created a 
                                UI senior management will use to guide future business decisisons. I've also taken several college
                                level courses outside of my university in Machine Learning and experiment with it in my free time.
                                I also know how to design and interface with SQL servers that store the data to be processed.
